She spent the whole phone call talking him down, calming him, and dealing with his feelings and well let’s face it, a bunch of his fucking whining about unfairness - bro read the room, you wanna talk about *unfair* ?.  Few people genuinely lend help or energy, without needing their own feelings cared for.  The trade off isn’t worth it.  We’ve become more reclusive and introverted, and we’re introverted to start.

After a lot of back and forth between doctors trying to determine whether the cancer had spread, we just received biopsy results showing he has bone mets in his left 7th rib, but there appear to be no lesions. Otherwise, he has one lymph node nearby that shows cancer, but no other spots. According to his care team, it’s a very localized area. He has already undergone one complete round of chemo and has since started immunotherapy.

            "- Welcome (and I'm sorry) to the club! I've been fighting for over 9 years and it has become routine, however no less alone. That feeling of being alone has never gone away, even when talking to other patients because they have their own life they need to focus on. I don't know if it's normal but you kind of get used to it. Just like you get used to everyone and their aunties neighbor telling you how to cure it. And you get used to never feeling like yourself again (I used this as an opportunity to become a better person, more loving and forgiving and open). Being scared takes a Back seat often when you give yourself hope to plan for a future. Short term goals help. I used to beg the universe to give me until the next avengers movie came out, or until my kids were old enough to play sports, or old enough to argue with me and piss me off. The longer I'm around the farther out my goals get. Do anything to get yourself out of a funk when you're scared, invite someone over to play card or board games  or watch TV or just let you vent. Don't let people's over-the-top positivity get to you. Just like the irrational cures they mean well, they just don't understand. Take it easy on yourself when chemo starts to slow you down, remind yourself it isn't permanent. You'll start to feel better a few months or so after your last round. The friends and family  that don't know what to do for you, so they offer help if you need it? Take them up on it. Let them clean for you or cook or shop for you. It's frustrating to have to ask but this is a time in your life you need to pet your support system work for you. If you have heavy feelings that won't quit, talk to the clinics social worker, they have resources. And don't be afraid to get a 2nd opinion. Any decent oncologist will be understanding. I go to OHSU in Oregon, went to MD Anderson for my 2nd opinion, only to find out the head of the sarcoma department there knew and respected my oncologist and confirmed I was in amazing hands, they gave me info on alternative trials they offered should my treatment plan not work out, and that was that.

It will be tough but your last act of love will give you comfort in the months to come after her passing, and hospice will make sure it is as comfortable for her as possible - if it is of any consolation, my mom felt absolutely nothing… like going to sleep, she snored for 5 hours.. like I heard her snore every night at home for so many years. :) Until her breathing slowly stopped and she just… slipped away to a better place.\n",

            "- My dad has been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. He’s going through aggressive chemotherapy every 2 weeks. I am the only caregiver in his life and I’m beginning to feel the strain. I work full time in a company where every day I’m on edge of getting fired for some stupid policy they add. All I want to do is stay home and take care of my father. It’s not even the care that’s hard for me, at least mentally/physically. I’m strong enough in both areas to handle this. It’s just becoming very hard to take care of him and work. I need the job in order to support him since he lives with me, but while I’m gone he’s all alone at home. I don’t know if I can afford care while I’m at work and he’s getting to the point where he’s losing his independence. I’m open to advice how to manage this. I have read some other advice on here that has already been helpful. I know in my heart he’s strong enough to regain his independence but he doesn’t have the energy to any kind of physical therapy. He’s atrophied significantly since this has started. Thanks for reading and if you have any suggestions I’m open to listening!\n",

By 2020, life threw its first challenge: she couldn’t conceive and was diagnosed with fibroids. With God’s grace and insurance, we made it through, and my mom, ever the caregiver, embraced her like her own daughter. By 2021, we were blessed with a baby boy, and life felt like it was finally coming together.\n",

            "But in 2022, the storm clouds rolled in. My van was vandalized, my wife was diagnosed with breast cancer, and my mom received a stage 4 lung cancer diagnosis—all in the same month. It was chaos, but I had no choice but to step into the caregiver role. My family helped with Mom while I focused on my wife, but chemo took its toll, and she lost her job. I worked tirelessly to keep us afloat.\n",
